<p id="film"> When my sibings and I were younger, we all had small stuffed pandas that we used to play with.
I was the only one who usually directs and write the songs for music videos of our stuffed pandas. We would also make a
news video like the pandas were news anchors. I really liked making videos and making film. I thought I would make out
of a career but as I was taking classes in high school, it felt more like a hobby than a career on its own. Fortunately, as a
side job, I would try to be a movie director and make a documentary about my life. :)</p>

<p id="writing"> One way to cope with my feelings is to write about it. Throughout elementary school, I would always
write about my experiences. One step away from becoming famous on Twitter! ;) In Junior High, I was in to more advanced
and for some reason, I would make stories for no reason. I used to carry so many journal. Now i only have three. One for
recording my dreams at night. One for experiences; it does sound like a diary but I don't keep up with it. Finally, one
for my poems. I will be honest that I am a bit rusty when I started high school. If I have time, I would try to complete
a page at least in one of my journals. There is one hobby I would like to be consistent with my writing is calligraphy
but right now I'm still in the beginning stages of it.</p>
